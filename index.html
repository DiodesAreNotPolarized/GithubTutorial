			After you've made changes on your computer, you're going to want to also change the files in the online reposity. To do this, there are a few commands you will need to use.<br>
			First, you will have to <code>git add -A</code>. This command adds all the changes you've changed to be commited later.<br>
			Then, you'll need to commit to your repo with <code> git commit -m "commit message"</code>. You should specify what you have changed in this commit.
